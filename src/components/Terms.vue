    <h2>LEASING RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>You will receive an encoded MP3 file of the untagged song. The song file can be delivered digitally through email. Leasing rights allow you to use the beat (or song) for non-profit promotional use or demos. You have full rights to record, mix the beat/song in any shape, way, or form (except reselling the beat).  Once you lease a beat off the website you have agreed to a non-exclusive rights agreement to the beat. In the event that someone buys exclusive rights to the beat you have leased, your rights shall stand and the beat is still yours to use. You may also acquire new leasing rights if you wish to sell more than 5,000 copies since your contract predates exclusive sale. Greater Good will not receive a royalty from the sale of records or downloads for releases sold under 5,000 copies. You must however give full credit to Greater Good on all commercial recordings, album releases, and mixtape releases. With leasing option you have the right record one music video. Upon purchasing leasing rights, Greater Good owns the beat(s) and has the right to resell the beat(s) to any other party until exclusive rights have been purchased.</p>
    

    <h2>EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS</h2>

Exclusive rights grant you unlimited commercial recordings and broadcasts. You have full rights to record, mix the beat/song in any shape, way, or form (except reselling the beat), do live performances license your song to Film/TV/Movie companies. Greater Good request 50/50 split publishing for any track that we produced that's released commercially. You cannot alter the beat unless given permission to do so by Greater Good. You will receive a contract by email or fax granting you exclusive rights to the beat. Greater Good may no longer lease or sell the beat/song, except for prior leasing rights holders and his/her own promotional page (no downloads there).
